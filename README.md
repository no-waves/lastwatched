Use this script in a folder with lots of .mkv files to figure out which one was last watched.

### Usage
* Clone repo or just copy the simple script into an empty file called lastwatch.
* For easiest use, make the file executable
* Move lastwatched into your path somewhere (ex. ~/bin)
* reload/reopen terminal as needed
* move to video directory
    * `cd path/to/video/directory`
* run the script
  * `lastwatched`
